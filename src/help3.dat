 If an element is in more than one layer it normally cannot be analyzed
 except by stoichiometry because the apportionment of x-rays among the
 layers is not known a priori.  The composition of the element in one of
 the layers can be determined, however, if its composition is fixed in
 the remaining layers.  The calculation then proceeds iteratively by
 forcing the sum of the calculated k-ratios of that particular element
 in all layers to equal the experimental k-ratio.'

 To invoke this option, use the switch "m" (e.g. FeKa,m) for the element
 in the layer for which you want the composition to be calculated if you
 are using a pure element standard. Use the switch "n" (e.g. O Ka,n) if
 you are using a compound standard.  For the other layers where the
 element is present the switch "s" (stoichiometry) must be used or the
 composition of that layer must be fixed.
