Fchar and Fcont: characteristic x-ray and continuum x-ray fluorescence
factors, respectively.  Defined as: (kratio calculated with char.(cont.)
fluorescence contributions minus kratio calculated without char.(cont.)
fluorescence contribution divided by the kratio calculated with
char.(cont.) fluorescence contributions.  This can be understood as the
theoretical % error added to the analysis if characteristic (or
continuum) x-ray fluorescence contributions are ignored.  If a compound
standard is used for the element, the factors Fchar and Fcont are
calculated with respect to the compound standard k-factor. A negative
factor indicates stronger fluorescence in the standard; a positive factor
indicates stronger fluorescence in the specimen.
