Fchar and Fcont: characteristic x-ray and continuum x-ray fluorescencefactors, respectively.  Defined as: (kratio calculated with char.(cont.)fluorescence contributions minus kratio calculated without char.(cont.)fluorescence contribution divided by the kratio calculated withchar.(cont.) fluorescence contributions.  This can be understood as thetheoretical % error added to the analysis if characteristic (orcontinuum) x-ray fluorescence contributions are ignored.  If a compoundstandard is used for the element, the factors Fchar and Fcont arecalculated with respect to the compound standard k-factor. A negativefactor indicates stronger fluorescence in the standard; a positive factorindicates stronger fluorescence in the specimen.
