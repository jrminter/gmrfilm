A carriage return provides the default response which is given in parentheses (where appropriate). This program will calculate k-ratios given a set of film compositions and thicknesses, or, it will calculate film compositions and thicknesses from a set of experimental k-ratios.  Bulk systems can also be handled. An element in a layer can be analyzed by stoichiometry. An element can be analyzed by difference with the bulk model. ---------------------------------------------------------------------
